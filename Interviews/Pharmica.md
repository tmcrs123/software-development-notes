Questions about company:

- Given there are a lot of competition (boots, superdrug, lloys farmacy), does pharmica have a strong market position?
- Why are you hiring for this role? Replacment/ team growth?
- 

Questions about the role:

- 100% in person? No hybrid?
- What's the companies approach to training and development? Is there a budget per person? 
- Why HTMX? No react/angular?
- Using .NET core? Or MVC, Blazor, etc...


Small team (5 -7 developers)
Center london, no hybrid
Uses MVC but looking to move to react/angular
Growing team
HTMX 
No training budget

My feeling on it: Only take it if there's nothing better.
