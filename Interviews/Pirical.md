Lineup:

 Introductions  
* Your career to date / future aspirations  
	* Looking to settledown professionally, and earn my stripes as a fullstack dev now that I accomplished one of my main life goals
	
* One behaviour-driven question  
	* ???


* An introduction to Pirical and vacancies  

* Any questions you may have
	* Can you tell me more about the company?  It seems like the 2 products are so different!
	* Role:
		* Training and development budget?
		* Is this a fully frontend role or is there openess to transition to a more fullstack position?
		* Just checking is this a fully remote or hybrid role? Job description is contradictory


Tech stack is cool but this is mostly frontend. Hybrid is good, start-up feel to it, think fast paced not big teams 2 days in the office 

3 stage interview, behivoral, then next stage is technical and it's likely to be mostly angular and the last is inteview with partener/manager/whatever
